## Notes 
<!-- Other important details discussed during the meeting can be entered here. -->
As a general Note, the meeting was not as productive as expected in terms of decition taking on tasks definition and prioritization as it was more foused on discussing how people could be as autonomus as possible while challenging the AGP-40 scope itself and proposing other resource allocation mechanism, discussion that did not reach any consensus during the call.
 - Figuring out how to self organize
 - Detail the scope of the AGP deliverables in tangible terms
     - Julian: we should spent some time in figuring out what we are and the first point in the scope should be to define this.
     - Would it make sense to build up working groups for AGP engagement, processes, create resource hubs, governance tools onboarding etc... ?? There seems to be a genreal agreement about this.

While there was no way to discuss all items in Agenda, there was a general agreement to move forward with the following...

## Action Items
 - Coop Membership and Bylaws (scope) --> This will define a minimun viable governance framework for the cooperative to operate as decentralized and autonomus as possible, guaranteeing actions will be taken in an rganized way.
     - Julian (co-lead)
     - Gustavo (co-lead)
 - Coop Workflow (meta governance / resource management)
     - Luke (Lead)
     - Gustavo
     - burrrata
