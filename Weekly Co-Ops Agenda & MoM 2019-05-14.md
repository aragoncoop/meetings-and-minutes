Gus set recording (highly recommended, link above)
**re documentation**
Gus - taking care of the product, making this straightforward
using new tools & tech for trade and orgs, as well as family and friends

Community research (in current Aragon product), adds value

taking care of users, close barriers
'noobs' on WG be big+, keep it simple and usable (danger of too much tacit knowledge)

education working group relationship?
engage an audience that haven't realised they require such tools yet (youtube video, links on twitter,closing gaps in approaches and awareness, engage w. community (how reward?) 
- it's also a useful barrier 'so people go over it', attract 'early adaptors' etc)
licensing affords duplicating content across various platforms
good 1st task for new members

cfdao notes
enhance coop & relation engagement w.wider network


Rinkeby Voting Outcomes
last wk
no clearly agreed overall governance model (personal note - I disagree w. no clear intention - we have it!)
3 questions:
1) agree mvm 
2) ask community to validate our proposal
3) use offchain app to assist gov processes
35% participation
assumption that not only people missed vote but that there were abstentions
1 & 2 passed, 3rd failed (check outcomes)
*'lack of discussionary engagement or involvement' - rational; no deep thought'
clearly not a BINDING VOTE, but signalling important

should we create different tier of participation - not interested in non-agp participation
25% signalling, & then 60% quorum for final binding vote
provides good feel for community sentiment

MRT Tokens
can redeploy if required
Luke's overall context
for decision making

relartion between mbr mrt tokens on mainnet - require solutions, establish levels of membership
Julian - strongly argue mbr token is the aim for new members, the 'golden ticket' and has most 'value'
'atm' structured such that mbr voting has control over finance, no point just 1 mrt (all agree), Luike currently has admin rights (safety)
can redeploy rinkeby dao's if req
should be for play
mainnet permissions will also require changing
resetting of mrt tokens on mainnet also
